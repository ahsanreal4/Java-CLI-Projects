This is a simple broadcast server that will allow clients to connect to it, send messages that will be broadcasted to all connected clients.

## Steps to Run
Run the Main.java file and use the following commands

start - This command will start the server.        
connect - This command will connect the client to the server.   
stop - This command will stop the execution of the program.

When the server is started using the server start command, it should listen for client connections on the specified port. 
When a client connects and sends a message, the server will broadcast this message to all connected clients.

The server is also able to handle multiple clients connecting and disconnecting gracefully.
